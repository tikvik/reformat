          <p><h2>1. The Failure</h2><p>Legal studies are at their lowest point in history. Whatever their leaning, they seem to be unable to produce anything resembling an understanding of law – let alone possible uses of its tools. Legal studies, nowadays, seem to be trapped in some grotesque parody of what academy, according to some weird Ivy League fantasy, should look like, without any of its expected outcomes. On the one hand, we have scholars aiming at proving time and again why everything legal and juridical is right as it is, while others, on the other hand, are desperately trying to show how everything is wrong. Beyond this attribution of values and the parroting of theories supposed to justify it, nothing happens – but bland, boring, useless bavardage. The only domain in which, apparently, there is some life left in law is the one of legal history – whose field, at least, stays structured according to real standards of research. The rest simply is discount academia – and boredom galore. There is no surprise, then, if law is falling more and more outside of the scope not only of researchers from other fields, but also of the general public, whose views on it more and more resemble to the clichés jumped out of an HBO or Netflix procedural series. Perhaps could it be heralded as a success – but only for those who would consider that transforming law into a completely esoteric discipline is a good thing. For saner minds, this is the saddest picture one can thing of: the one “a crucial fixture of democracy” being considered as so dull and uninteresting that its knowledge is now reserved to equally dull and uninteresting interpreters. The problem, however, is not so much boredom as what boredom entails: a general laziness when it comes to think the machinery of law – and the possibilities entailed in it. For decades now, at least since the advent of Kelsenian orthodoxy, law has been considered as a set of general and abstract norms whose validity depends upon its inscription within a given, legitimate, institutional system. Nobody, from whatever side of the church, wouldn’t even discuss this claim – except, perhaps, for putting into question the legitimacy of said institutional system, or the perversion of the validation process of rules. Depending on the day, society, politics, economy, ethics or even aesthetics will come to the rescue – so that the core claim remains untouched: law is, and must be, about rules, norms, regulations, ought-to-be. If there is something that distinguishes law from other practices, it is this one: law is the social fabric of the normative. Problem is: nothing could be more wrong.</p><h2>2. The Mistake</h2><p>Law is not, and has never been, about norms. This means that, contrarily to what is still considered as not even deserving consideration, law has nothing to do with all the activities pertaining to the conception, adoption, proclamation, execution, interpretation and application of rules, regulations, legislation, and the like. To put it into even clearer terms: law has never had anything to do with governments, legislators and judges. These three spheres certainly belong to the institutional equipment of societies – but as political accessories, so to speak. There are the cheap jewels thrown at the face of laymen while the important issues are dealt with elsewhere. If we still consider that law’s reality is directly related to said spheres, it is only because of a remarkable chance: the coming to the rescue of “law” of a Greek invention whose consequences are still a heavy burden – namely, philosophy. The invention of the category of nomos, and its philosophical description as an order whose function was to parallel the organisation of the sky with the one of the Earth, has given nobility to what was, until then, a simple set of thesmoi whose consequences were strictly local. With the idea of nomos, the assumption that law, whatever it is, could play a role in the ordering of the city, and in bridging it together with a higher level of necessities, suddenly received some credence. Of course, it was long fought against – especially by Roman lawyers, who saw no necessity to confuse what they were doing with the wet dreams of philosophers or advocates wanting to submit the functioning of law to principles whose choice and definition they were reserving for them alone. It literally took more than a millennium for the idea of law as directly linked to the normative order of societies to be accepted – but only because of the fantastic amnesia of lawyers themselves. Such an amnesia, however, was quite easily understandable: after all, lawyers were part of a transaction stipulating that if they were to accept this understanding of law, then they would be a part of those who would decide about it. This transaction was put forth by Cicero and his followers in Ancient Rome, by the Humanists at the time of Renaissance, by philosophers during Enlightenment, etc. Yet, it was never fully acknowledged because, otherwise, the ideal law that had so been designed wouldn’t simply function – as its functioning is, and has always been, based on something else that rules and norms, nomoi and leges. Law is not a deontic practice. It is much more.</p><h2>3. The Story</h2><p>What is law, then? The answer is pretty simple. So simple, even, that it is really funny to see, repeated from treatise to treatise, the notion that law would be hard to define, and that definitions abound, contradicting each other. This is not true. If there has never been a stable definition of law in recent times, it is only because all the suggested ones were simply concentrating on what law is not – but should ideally be, so that the order of things that it is supposed to guarantee, would not be put into question. Because what law is, is the following: law is the operator of the necessity of continuities. And that is all. What law is, is what it does. And what it does is to set up linkages – or, to be more precise, articulations. Law is the set of operations that articulates continuities – that builds up continuities in such a way that other operations could follow. Romans had a word for that: ius. Unfortunately, the inherent limitations of English makes it impossible to distinguish between law understood as lex (or nomos) and law understood as ius. Usually, this word is mistakenly translated with “rights” – which is the weakest translation one could think of. For what does “rights” mean? The faculties given to a certain subject by a certain law. Rights are the product of rules and regulations – they are tickets for players to enter the deontic game. As such, though, they don’t do anything. They are just there to allow someone to claim the application of a given rule to his case – or to deny such an application to someone else (be it an authority). “Rights” are the subjective side of legislation. Ius, on another hand, is a word that had nothing to do with legislation or normativity. As numerous legal historians and linguists have shown, ius meant law in a non-deontic sense – as in “juridical”, as opposed to “legal”. What is juridical is not the norms and regulations that the authorities of a society have adopted and intend to see applied, but the operations through which such an application is even thinkable. These operations, such as marriage, filiation, obligation, qualification, adoption, etc., have never ever been conceived through deontic devices. Nowadays, in every single legal system of the world (or considered as such), the main categories articulating the functioning of rules and adjudication are not legal categories – are not categories designed and defined through laws. The have been created and perfected by jurisconsults throughout history, so that they can contribute to the solving of impossibilities – and keep law going.</p><h2>4. The Proposal</h2><p>What does this mean? It means that, as far as law is concerned, the study of rules and judgments are a pure waste of time. If one is to study law in a non-superficial way, it is the ensemble of operations constituting ius that has to become the focus of attention. But it also means that spending fantastic amounts of time and energy in trying to understand why and how the institutional system of lex is right or wrong is both pointless and useless. We don’t need to keep on searching for the ultimate guarantee, legitimation or justification of law – be it the political consent and interest of the population (or its dominated parts, whatever they are). We don’t need to try and determine what are the external factors putting into question the purity of the internal reasons defended by the most stubborn positivists – because it is exactly the same thing. In both cases, it misses law altogether. No doubt that it would be of a great interest for sociologists or political scientists, but certainly not for lawyers. Since it amounts to considering law from the point of view of the limit, positivists, naturalists, realists, race theorists, feminist jurisprudence scholars, law &amp; economics researchers (an oxymoron if there ever was one), etc., are all critical. When Emmanuel Kant, at the helm of modernity, defined its critical program, it was precisely on these terms: the one of the limiting of reason – and of the verification of the adequation of the functioning of reason to the norms that subjects would have chosen together. The focus on the deontic, in order to either defend or destroy its current status, is then the focus on critique, precisely seen as the moment of judgment of what is – and, of course, of its condemnation if it doesn’t fit with its program. Shifting the perspective towards the operations of law, however, may allow for another point of view, not interested in limitations and impossibilities anymore, but on what law can do – and could do. This would imply to insist on how invention provides the key to the history of ius, from the Romans to the present, and then a certain sense of the possible. Law has never been about negating possibilities, but about finding tricks to negotiate with what was reputed impossible. Time, nature, death, biology, geography: there is nothing that the operations of law couldn’t transgress – and as daily as with an adoption, or our interactions with abstractions such as “the State”. But, for that, we need to pass past the critical stage of legal studies, and, at last, open up to its post-critical horizon.</p><h2>5. The Goal</h2><p>This task is rendered all the more urgent by the current political, economical, ecological and even ethical moment that we are living. Carrying on with the consensus that has defined modern law, both in order to defend it or to try and undermine it, can only lead to a growing marginalization of law. This time, however, this marginalization will not take the form of contempt or ignorance from the laymen, but from those responsible for the ediction and application of rules themselves – be it at the level of governments, parliaments and tribunals. Since the focus on lex has given free reign to the idea that law is only about rules and regulations, the juridical constraints that the operations of ius incarnate can be set aside with a more and more visible impudence. If law is only made out of norms, then those who possess the power to decide about norms can also claim the power to decide about the possibilities that law can help in exploring (or not). Confronted to the rise of an autocratic tendency even at the core of countries considering themselves as paragon examples of “rule of law”-governed State, forgetting about the operational nature of law is the equivalent of forgetting law altogether – and replacing it with an object upon which political sides can endlessly argue. By adopting a post-critical gaze, shifting interest from norms to operations, on the contrary, there is a chance to re-equip lawyers themselves in their struggle for making law a relevant actor within a crumbling political field – an actor that could compete with politics, economics, science, religion, and so on, in the formulation of possibilities for future societies. To put it in another way: it is not so much the militants that should get accustomed to law again, than the lawyers who have to turn into militants – because law is by nature militant. It is militant not necessarily because of a its political leaning; it is militant insofar as it seeks to keep intact its own capacity to invention in the face of proclaimed impossibilities. The consequence should be clear, then: law is not on the side of order, but on the one of chaos; it is the exploration of the possibilities that orders, whatever they purpose or tendency, always try to control – with words like “reality”, “justice”, “life”, etc. Since legal operations can reverse time, make dead people act, reinvent the nature of things so that farm dogs can become the equivalent of bricks, etc., “reality”, or “justice”, or “life”, or whatever else, cannot be considered as relevant limits for law. Ius is limitless – and this is why it is, intrinsically, revolutionary.</p></p>
