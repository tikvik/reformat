        <p>You can use the app on Ubuntu 18.04 or newer.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Software installation</h3>
        <p>In order install the Human Activities program successfully to your computer, you must go through the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click on the Download icon and extract the Human Activities program to the Downloaded Items folder.  You will extract the compressed file called "human-activities_0.11.0-1.debian.tar.xz" by double-clicking. A window will appear that allows you to confirm the Install command.<img class="img-fluid" src="images/Ubuntu_1.jpg"></li>
          <li>Then, you will launch the program using Show Applications in the lower left corner of the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to configure data archiving</h3>
        <p>In order for the program to function well, you need to follow a few rules. One of them involves creating a folder called Paid Work, Unpaid Work, Recreation and Others.  In these folders, you can store data based on given activities. The Others item is meant for actions such as free-time activities, procrastination or lazing around.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create items by renaming the folders: Documents, Videos, Music and Pictures. You will find these in the left side panel of the Files Manager window that you will open using the tool of the same name in the upper left corner of the screen. Right-click to select each file and enter the rename command. You will gradually change the file names to Paid Work, Unpaid Work, Recreation and Others.<img class="img-fluid" src="images/Ubuntu_5.jpg"></li>
          <li>Run the Human Activities program and in the menu bar in the right corner of the screen a simple program logo in the form of a colorful pie graph will appear. Click on it and confirm Configurations. In the window that appears, select the programs that you want the Human Activities program to monitor, i.e. Paid Work, Unpaid Work, Recreation and Others.<img class="img-fluid" src="images/Ubuntu_2.jpg"></li>
          <li>Then, in the application menu, open the Advanced Settings menu (window) and select Hide.<img class="img-fluid" src="images/Ubuntu_3.jpg"></li>
          <li>Afterwards, restart your computer.</li>
          <li>The most entertaining part of the configuration then follows - the process of moving data to the newly-named items. This step is not configured automatically; the user must sort it out him-/herself.  It is the most difficult part of the entire process, but the results are worth it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Data Monitoring</h3>
        <p>Part of the application includes a simple, statistical overview in the form of graphic icons on the operating system's control panel. After you click on the overview, an entire list of all items and their usage (expressed as percentages) will appear. In the basic configuration of the Human Activities program, the data stored on your hard drive is recalculated every 4 hours. The sum is calculated based on ratios of size to the amount of information in the given folder and the time spent interacting with the data.</p>
        <h3>Uninstalling the program</h3>
        <p>Deleting the application is relatively simple.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First, exit the Human Activities program using the menu bar in the upper right corner of the screen. There, you will click Quit.<img class="img-fluid" src="images/Ubuntu_6.jpg"></li>
          <li>Then, open Show Application in the lower left corner of the screen. Right-click on the Human Activities program and from the menu choose Show Details.<img class="img-fluid" src="images/Ubuntu_7.jpg"></li>
          <li>In the window that opens up, click on Human Activities and confirm the Remove command. Thanks to this, you can permanently delete the program from your computer.<img class="img-fluid mb-0" src="images/Ubuntu_8.jpg"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/Ubuntu_9.jpg"></li>
        </ol>
