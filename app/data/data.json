Ztrácejí důvěru a nedokáží čelit proměněným globálním silám, ať už se jedná o geopolitický vliv Číny, Ruska a USA, nebo radikální islám či migrační tlak. Evropské instituce a národní politické reprezentace tvrdošíjně obhajují mocenský a ideologické uspořádání a opakují recepty osmdesátých a devadesátých let, které, jak ukazuje vývoj poledních desetiletí, radikálním tempem pozbývají platnosti. Namísto sebereflexe a přehodnocování politik hledají příčiny krize v působení vnějších jevů, například akce Ruska nebo nedostatečně organické přijetí evropského projektu a jeho ideologie, který bez výjimky označuje za populismus. </p><p>Zejména země střední Evropy se potom stávají místem nejviditelnějšího střetu mezi krizí postiženým evropským projektem a formulováním různých politických, institucionálních a ideologických alternativ. I proto jsou pravidelně peskovány za nedostatky solidarity, demokracie či evropanství. Střední Evropa je přes všechny své problémy i nedostatky alternativ, které formuluje, obětí dvojích standardů evropské liberální elity. Plošná démonizace těchto alternativních projektů je stejně pošetilá jako jejich adorace. Co spojuje tzv. populistická hnutí a stávající  evropskou ideologii, je neschopnost najít východiska, která by odpovídala potřebám Evropy 21. století.</p><p>Tento projekt hledá východiska odpovídající dnešním potřebám. Hlásí se k ideálu svobodné a demokratické Evropy, která žije podle zásad sociální spravedlnosti a která respektuje své nové členy stejně jako ty staré. Hledání funkčního modelu Evropy vyžaduje diskusi. Musí se vést bez předsudků, oživit pozapomenuté myšlenkové tradice a především vykročit z elitního světa politických, akademických a technokratických debat. Naším posláním je takovou debatu podněcovat a organizovat.</p>"

                        "text" : "<p>Track back to 1990, and most observers were predicting that, as liberal democracy arrived in the countries of the former Soviet bloc, so patterns of political parties similar to those in the west would arrive in the countries emerging from state socialism. Instead, something quite different happened. Nearly all parts of Europe, also the United States and some other countries with established liberal democracy, entered a period of weak political parties and the rise of new movements based mainly on hostility to foreigners of various kinds. Similar developments started to take place in central Europe. There may be convergence between east and west, but it is not what had been expected.</p><p>Things had begun to change in the west during the 1980s, when a number of new xenophobic parties were founded – or existing conservative parties started to change and adopt more nationalistic positions. By the early years of the new century some of these had begun to make clear breakthroughs into the political mainstream. If we define this point as when a party achieves the support of more than 10% of the total electorate, then such parties became prominent in some countries between 2000 and 2010: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland; in others some time before 2020: Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden. In several cases these parties had periods as parts of governing coalitions. The Front National had done well in French presidential elections since 2002, but did not enjoy so much success in those for parliament. The British electoral system punishes small parties, but even there the anti-European, anti-immigrant party UKIP attracted the support of 8% of the electorate in 2015, and the well established Conservative Party started to turn itself into a nationalistic, anti-European one.</p><p>It is difficult to assess the situation in most of central Europe outside Hungary and Poland, as parties of all kinds have become very volatile, in terms of both their popular support and their programmes. However, the adoption of xenophobic themes can be seen in several cases. Outside Europe, the election of Donald Trump to the presidency of the US in 2016 can be added to the list. Although he stood for an established party, it was clear that he and his supporters had ‘captured’ that party from its usual leaders, and he certainly used themes of hostility to both foreign nations and immigrants and ethnic minorities as part of his platform.</p><p>As with all complex social changes, explanations exist at two levels: underlying causes; and sudden processes that produce rapid and widespread change. Here we shall examine the former, and then go on to the latter.</p><p>In the established democracies of the west the ties that had once bound the majority of voters to particular party identities had been weakening for decades. These identities had been forged in earlier, sometimes violent, struggles of the late 19th and early 20th century against anti-democratic regimes, over inclusion in and exclusion from political citizenship based on social class and, often, religion. The right to vote was usually determined by criteria of property ownership that excluded the great majority of working people. People in minority religions or caught up in conflicts between Christianity and secularism also often found that their religious identity led to them suffering various kinds of exclusion. People on the wrong side of these various barriers found parties and movements willing to lead them in demands for inclusion. Those on the right side of barriers found parties wanting to protect their privileges against the excluded. As a result, many people found that their social identity also gave them a deeply felt political identity. Whether this could be freely expressed depended on whether the country concerned had more or less free elections, but by the end of World War II this was the case in those parts of Europe not dominated by either fascist or communist dictatorships. Identities forged in bitter struggles over inclusion became, paradoxically, the basis of more peaceful forms of electoral conflict and political stability.</p><p>But identities forged in past conflicts weakened over time as their origins became mere memories. This became especially true as the two forces that had produced these identities also weakened: the class structure of industrial and agricultural society, and the Christian religion. Deindustrialization and the growth of the services economy meant that fewer people worked in the industries that had produced the class structure of capitalist society. In Europe, though not the US, religion ceased to be a major force in society. By the end of the 20th century it had become difficult for large numbers of voters to see any particular party as representing them. The old party systems remained in place, but smaller proportions of electorates vote for them, and many parties themselves have no strong sense of what they are about.</p><p>In central Europe the journey has been quite different, but the point of arrival is similar. State socialism did not permit struggles over rival social identities. By the 1980s widespread movements of general opposition to the dictatorship had developed, and in the initial post-1990 elections parties based on these seemed about to dominate newly established political systems. But these movements had been held together by opposition to the Soviet regime; once that had fallen their own internal divisions became evident. They have fallen back into a wider scene of parties with only shallow social roots, based on wealthy individuals or on very narrow appeals, few of which attract strong and lasting loyalties among voters.</p><p>Differences between east and west remain, as the old parties in the latter still retain some hold, but right across Europe there is today a landscape of weak parties, with uncertain identities of their own, attracting strong support among only a declining proportion of the electorate.</p><p>If the strength and durability of political parties depends on their representing identities that ordinary voters can feel as important to them, and if such identities are today in short supply, there is one that survives and increasingly stands alone and thereby becomes prominent: nation. It is an identity that most people can feel, and it can be fundamental to our sense of who we are. It defines the borders of the geographical space in which we are entitled to feel at home, not an outsider. It often defines the language we speak, the mass media that we use, and the sports teams we support. It is a deep social identity, but it also has very immediate political significance, since national territories define the most important levels of government.</p><p>The political meaning of nationalism changes with time and circumstance. In late 19th century Europe it meant struggles for liberation of people subordinated to external empires, mainly that of Austro-Hungary. In the mid-20th century it mainly referred to more global struggles against the domination of the British, French, Dutch and some other colonial empires. As battles for freedom and self-government these were democratic, popular movements against despotic ruling elites, and nationalism and democracy ran together. However, once self-government has been achieved, nationalist movements face a dilemma. Do they continue the fight for democracy within the nation, or does a domestic elite simply walk into the spaces vacated by the imperial rulers? Of the liberations from Austro-Hungary, only that in the then Czechoslovakia succeeded in sustaining democratic government until it was crushed by another external force, Nazi Germany. Elsewhere nationalism changed from being a means to attack foreign elites to a means to defend local ones.</p><p>Post-liberation nationalism is a dangerous tool. By continuing to focus on foreign enemies, domestic elites are able to draw attention away from their own abuses of power and exploitation of the people. Worse, once independence has been fully achieved, national fervour can be sustained only by identifying new foreign foes. This might involve picking fights with other countries, or at least creating atmospheres of bad relations with them. This is a dangerous tactic, as it leads at least to restrictions in trade but possibly also to war. Alternatively, or additionally, local ethnic minorities and groups of immigrants can be picked on and defined as hostile to the integrity of the nation. This can lead to persecution and harassment of these groups.</p><p>Following this experience of 20th century nationalism, most post-war western political leaders became very cautious how they used it. From time to time they did find it convenient to stir up national sentiment in order to achieve unity around their projects. Also, ambitious outsiders would use appeals to national solidarity against foreigners and immigrants in order to generate support for new movements. Most leaders of established parties across the spectrum held these developments at the margins. In the east the rulers of the Soviet Union used traditional appeals to the solidarity of the Russian people to consolidate their rule. This meant that they did not permit politicized nationalism to develop within the countries of the Warsaw Pact, though they were keen to develop purely cultural, folkloric expressions of national identity in many of the countries over which they effectively ruled. But now, in the early 21st century, the boundaries are down. Xenophobic parties are making substantial progress, and many established politicians feel it either opportune or necessary to echo their themes.</p><h2>Why now?</h2><p>This brings us to the question, why now? A major event at the start of this century were the Islamic terrorist attacks in the US in November 2001. This came at a time when immigration from Islamic countries was beginning to grow. The wars that the US and her allies unleashed against Afghanistan and Iraq, and the subsequent destabilization of Syria and other parts of the region, then generated large waves of refugees, a small proportion of whom came to Europe and the US. Fear of Muslim people became widespread, even in countries like Hungary and Poland to which hardly any refugees came. Xenophobic parties could take this fear and turn it into a generalized hostility to foreign minorities of all kinds. In no case was this stronger than in the UK, where hostility to European immigrants led a majority of the population to provoke the country’s exit from the European Union.</p><p>But these movements are not just xenophobic. They usually also respond to a wider range of discontents. They often link a revival of nationalism to a reassertion of socially conservative values, hostile to such recent developments as the rise of the role of women and more liberal attitudes to homosexuality. A powerful sense of nostalgia links these themes, which can also extend to a desire to return to the declining occupational world of industrial society. This last in turn strengthens a further form of xenophobia, at least in the west: hostility to the changes in world trade that have shifted manufacturing industry to countries in central Europe and the Far East.</p><p>This last became particularly salient after the financial crisis of 2008, which demonstrated that the financial and economic model in which we had all been told to believe was fundamentally flawed. It might have been expected that this failure would assist anti-capitalist parties and movements. To some extent it did, but a critique of existing elites could be more easily incorporated into the nationalistic and nostalgic rhetoric that had been establishing itself: hostility to immigrants, to the European Union, in the case of Trump’s US hostility to most organizations for international cooperation.</p><p>Paradoxically, although individual nationalisms are rivals, they have been rather successful in forming a kind of ‘nationalist international’. The paradox is seen most clearly in relations between the Fidesz government of Viktor Orbán and Matteo Salvini’s xenophobic La Lega in Italy. Orbán stirs up hostility to the EU because it tried to persuade central European countries help take the burden of refugees from the shoulders of Greece and Italy; Salvini stirs up hostility to the EU because he says it has done too little to make other countries help Italy with that burden. In principle Orbán and Salvini are on opposite sides in that dispute; but in practice they are close allies and friends. They are together in their hatred of the EU and their ability to use that hatred for political mobilization.</p><p>Co-operation among these groups has recently become more organized under the auspices of Steve Bannon, a former close associate of Donald Trump, who has brought American money to the organization of hostility to liberal developments and to the EU. To date it is difficult to identify any major success of this co-operation; its attempts to win a breakthrough in the 2018 elections to the European parliament were not very successful. Nevertheless, the power of nationalism and resentment at immigrants and refugees, and with them the other discontents being felt by socially conservative people remain extremely potent forces.</p>",

                        "text": "<p>The Czech opinion about Brussels has been slowly improving from its all-time low in 2015 when only 29% of Czech citizens trusted in the EU according to the Eurobarometer. Four years later their trust increased by 10% but it remains among the lowest in the EU, and it is the lowest in the group of four Visegrad countries, which has been a long-term trend. This lack of trust cannot be put down to populism, nationalism or illiberalism, though these tendencies have been diagnosed by many observers in Central Europe for some time. None of these features are especially salient in Czechia if the situation there is compared with those elsewhere. Nor can it be explained by economic problems as the Czech economy has been growing and the unemployment rate has remained low. Moreover, the Czech political debate does not come up with any ideological or geopolitical alternatives to the EU.</p><p>Thus, there is no simple explanation for the lack of support to the EU in Czechia. The argument that I advance does not provide a full explanation of this puzzle. But it brings to light a social fact that has been so far neglected in the debate about the merits of the EU in the eyes of Central Europeans. The argument is about European technocracy. However, this is not the usual claim that the EU is too technocratic to satisfy the democratic needs of the citizens.</p><p>Instead of that, I argue that the EU does not satisfy Czech technocratic expectations. It is not that the EU is not trusted because it is too technocratic but because its technocracy fails. First, I explain that the technocratic ideology is deeply embedded in the Czech society, having played an important role under the communist rule. I then show that after 1989 the return to Europe reinvigorated this technocracy, providing it with an additional legitimacy while promoting the EU on its technocratic merits. However, it is also a perceived lack of technocratic merits that gives rise to an important technocratic opposition against Brussels.</p><h2>Communist technocracy</h2><p>Technocracy can be defined in numerous ways. It is often understood as a rule of experts in opposition to democracy or ideology. In this respect, scholars usually observe it with a critical eye when looking at liberal democracies as it isolates decision making from a democratic oversight. On the other hand, it is seen more favourably in non-democratic systems, where it may present a competent alternative to ideological foolishness.</p><p>However, technocracy can also be defined in a neutral way as a problem-solving approach to political and social issues that avoids opening deep normative questions as it takes these for granted. It is compatible with a variety of ideologies and political programs, but it can also present a political program of its own. Therefore, technocracy, as I understand it, defines an approach to the world rather than a feature of a political system. Moreover, it defines a social group of technocrats who share this perspective and who participate in governance structures and public life.</p><p>Technocracy played an important role in communist Czechoslovakia. There technocrats were living in a symbiosis with the official ideology of Marxism-Leninism, sharing its main tenets. They were supposed to solve practical problems that were arising when these tenets were put into operation. In the 1950s they took for granted what they learned in Moscow, where the top technocrats studied. They did their best to transfer what they saw as a superior Soviet experience to Czechoslovakia to build up a communist society there.</p><p>However, their field experience taught them better. Especially in economy, they were discovering that the Soviet precepts and methods do not bring about more efficiency and prosperity, quite the contrary. In the 1960s, these Soviet-trained economic experts (e.g. Ota Šik, the economic reformist-in-chief in 1968) pointed to the failings of the economic models that many of them previously implemented.</p><p>However, they did not call for political changes and they did not put into doubt the basic principles of the socialist economy. Reformist technocrats considered socialism good; they just wanted to repair it. Their technocratic problem-solving brought about economic reform proposals that became central to the reformist communist agenda of 1968. Their practical arguments enjoyed a broad popular legitimacy in Czechoslovakia but they clashed with the advocates of ideological purity both at home and, more importantly, in Moscow. The ideologues were afraid that the proposed reforms would produce a drift away from socialism and the Soviet block and thus they felt obliged to intervene to suppress them.</p><p>Even though the ranks of the technocracy were purged after the Soviet intervention of 1968, the economic problems remained and the rulers needed technocracy to deal with them. In the late 1980s it was Moscow herself that tried to promote reforms that would save socialism and that were ideologically related with the Czechoslovak reformist program of twenty years before. However, these initiatives did not find much support in Prague. The Czechoslovak Communist Party leadership derived its legitimacy from the suppression of the 1968 reforms and it was only with utter reluctance that it adopted parts of perestroika. More importantly, the technocracy no longer had any faith in the reform of socialism. They paid lip service to the official ideology, and they made references to the opportunities of Perestroika but they looked to the West for guidance.</p><h2>Transition and accession technocracy</h2><p>The year of 1989 gave an enormous boost to the Czechoslovak technocracy. The discourse of the new elite that became widely adopted by society pictured the previous communist régime as criminal and incompetent. The new régime and its elite constructed its identity against both of these evils. Thus, former dissidents who were victims of communist crimes were supposed to guarantee its respect for human rights, democracy and its moral spine in general. However, they were not able to guarantee a competent rule as they did not have any administrative experience.</p><p>That was the task for the post-1989 technocracy. The government by experts was seen as an enormous progress from the previous governments of party apparatchiks. All these experts belonged to the communist technocracy, as there were no other experts after all. While most of them used to be members of the Communist Party and all of them used to work either in the official expert institutions or in the state companies, they also had first-hand experience with the failings of the centrally planned economy they were often in charge of. Therefore, they did not have to think twice before turning coats. They all became apostles of liberal capitalism, engineering the country’s economic transition, which focused on a fast and wholesale privatisation. Some technocrats stayed in the state administration while others, using their information and networks, grabbed at the privatisation opportunities and became businesspeople.</p><p>Either way the technocracy became the dominant political and ideological force of the Czech transition in the 1990s. It was represented by the neoliberal Civic Democratic Party led by Václav Klaus, who used to work in official research institutes in the 1970s and 1980s. Former dissidents either joined the technocratic project or were completely sidelined as they did not have much to offer during the transition period. Václav Havel cut a lonely figure; he was the president of the country but without any real clout in domestic politics.</p><p>The 1990s technocracy was based on the imitation of the Western models that enjoyed an enormous popularity in the public mind. Anything coming from the West was deemed superior to anything local. The slogan of a <em>return to Europe</em> that gave guidance to the Czech politics for almost two decades expressed these beliefs. However, gradually a split opened inside the technocracy on whom to imitate. The technocracy in charge of the transition looked up to the Anglo-American model of capitalism, worshipping Reagan, Thatcher, Hayek and Friedman. They did not pay much respect to Continental European models, which they suspected of being too close to socialism and therefore dysfunctional. In Europe they appreciated the Common Market but not much beyond that.</p><p>On the other hand, the preparation for the EU membership enhanced an alternative source of models that were centered on Brussels and on Germany as the EU’s leading power and the principal force behind its Eastern enlargement. As the EU accession was getting closer, the accession technocracy was gaining ground. Politically, it was represented by the Czech Social Democratic Party led by Miloš Zeman, an economist who, like Václav Klaus, was working in official research institutes in the 1970s and 1980s. It was mainly due to the EU presence that the accession technocracy became dominant during the accession and in the years that followed.</p><h2>Populist technocracy</h2><p>Despite the dominance of the accession technocracy that absorbed parts of the transition technocracy, the latter did not disappear. It was nourishing the Czech reluctance to join the common European currency on the grounds that its very construction is economically flawed. Later, the eurozone crisis, the ordeal of Greece and Italy, as well as the absurdity of Brussels’ demands for Slovak solidarity with the richer Greece seemed to confirm this analysis.</p><p>Moreover, the accession technocracy split up and the new stream of a populist technocracy arose. The split started to open with the eurozone crisis, which bred doubts about the competence of Brussels’ management, but it was fully accomplished by the migration crisis in 2015. The inability to secure the EU external borders as well as attempts by the European Commission to distribute migrants among the EU members according to the centrally set quotas raised an incomprehension that was both emotional and practical. What especially hurt was that the objections against the scheme that pointed to its impracticality were met with ideological, human rights-based lecturing from Brussels and Berlin. They were seen as overstepping their roles. Even though a part of the accession technocracy stuck to the usual line of Brussels knows best, other members of it became alienated.</p><p>However, by that time a new type of technocracy had been growing h2 for some time. It came from a multifaceted anti-corruption movement that was dusting off the Velvet Revolution calls for a government by experts rather than by incompetent and corrupt politicians. This time, though, the political movement that started a campaign based on the need for expertise was sponsored and led by Andrej Babiš, a Slovak billionaire who worked in a Czechoslovak foreign trade company in the 1980s and got rich in the wild privatisation period of the 1990s. Its ideology is based on Babiš’s belief that the government should be run like a business, or more specifically, like his own business empire, where the owner keeps control of everything. This populist technocracy is eclectic about the models to be imitated but they mostly come from business experience. Even though this perspective is not necessarily Eurosceptical as it recognises European economies of scale, Brussels’ bargaining power and networking opportunities, it will frequently clash with the EU, whose institutional logic differs from that of business. This then breeds a criticism of Brussels as incompetent.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>The EU has been criticised many times for being too technocratic. On the other hand, the most important criticism that has been levelled against Brussels in the Czech debate points to the failings of its technocracy, such as the flawed design of the common currency, the mismanagement of the migration crisis or a general incompetence. This insight may not have an unambiguous moral. But given that a functioning technocracy is rather appreciated, the European Commission should perhaps focus on the technocratic management for which it was designed. On the other hand, it should restrain its ambition to enhance its own political role or to promote its own version of European values as the Commission has been increasingly doing in recent years.</p>",

                        "text": "<p><i>The Light That Failed</i> joins the very popular genre of “crisis-of-democracy” literature. They all have one thing in common, with Trump’s victory and Brexit, all of a sudden (liberal) democracy is in crisis. Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Rodrigo Duterte’s Philippines, which were frowned upon as parochial failures to live up to the democratic standards (of the West) and confirmation of the “catching-up” revolution paradigm of the 90s, suddenly became the proof of democracy’s crisis and fragility. Through this prism the more distant events coalesced into a pattern of a global wave of nationalist, xenophobic, and authoritarian governments. But while all of these authors make some room for recent disruptions—the growth of inequality, the rise of social media, the backlash against immigration—they share a view that formed during the Cold War and seemed vindicated in 1989: that “democracy” means a cleaned-up version of what we do in Old Europe, complemented with capitalism, a word that hardly appears in their books because it is so deeply assumed. The main task of the book is to answer the question of why liberalism has been in visible crisis since the 2010s. The easy-dream scenario of creating a carbon copy of the West in the East in a relatively short and painless evolutionary catching-up process, where the focus has been on the big legal-constitutional transformations, has evaporated in the recent years and nowadays it is high time to discover and describe systematically the shadowy side of the process which begun in 1989.</p><p>The authors’ starting place is Francis Fukuyama’s thesis in his famous 1989 essay, “The End of His-tory”—that the collapse of the Soviet experiment signaled “the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism.” Here was a proposition, they argue, that not only appealed to “American self-love,” but was taken as “self-evident to dissidents and reformers living behind the Iron Curtain.” Krastev and Holmes identify here the crucial point in the debate on the crisis of liberal-ism, in this precise moment “liberalism [is] abandoning pluralism for hegemony,” and this forms the central thesis of their book. “This absence of alternatives, we submit, even more than the gravitational pull of an authoritarian past or historically ingrained hostility to liberalism, best explains the anti-Western ethos dominating post-Communist societies today.  . . . because, at some elementary level, human beings need choice, even just the illusion of it.” They further maintain that “resentment at liber-al democracy’s canonical status and the politics of imitation in general has . . . played a decisive role” in the authoritarian-populist turn, and not only in formerly Communist Europe, but in Russia and the United States as well.</p><p>The novelty in Krastev and Holmes’ book is the application of personal psychology to the politics of post-1989 liberalism with their imitation scheme. Central Europeans seemed not only to wholehearted-ly adopt the means and techniques of western liberal democracies, but also to introject their goals and desires. “When the cold war ended, racing to join the west was the shared mission of central and east-ern Europeans. Indeed, becoming indistinguishably western was arguably the principal aim of the revolutions of 1989. The enthusiastic copying of western models, accompanied as it was by the evac-uation of Soviet troops from the region, was initially experienced as liberation.” Holmes and Krastev emphasize the psychological and moral costs of this project. Somewhat puzzlingly, in the region the model long imitated has increasingly become an obstacle to the self-esteem and self-realisation of the imitators. Not only were the assimilators denied freedom of choice, but they had to deny their identity.</p><p>From here, Krastev and Holmes conclude that illiberalism is a delayed response to this unequal politi-cal and economic reconstitution of post-Soviet space. “This lack of alternatives, rather than the gravita-tional pull of an authoritarian past or historically ingrained hostility to liberalism, is what best explains the anti-western ethos dominating post-communist societies today. The very concept that “there is no other way” provided an independent motive for the wave of populist xenophobia and reactionary na-tivism that began in central and Eastern Europe, and is now washing across much of the world.” In addition, they were subjected to the judgment of their mentors, who constantly reminded them of their inadequacy, and in each subsequent attempt to approach the norm, they pointed to the distance that still separated them from it. This confirmed the inequality between the representatives of the model and its imitators: the elites of the West reminded those who wanted to join it that they still had a long way to go before they deserved recognition for their equals. This misrepresentation undermined the newcom-ers‘ sense of self-esteem and accumulated resentment and a desire for revenge.</p><p>The authors deliver their argument through three case studies: Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Russia and the United States. Each of these three, they say, has experienced a profound rejection of liberal values for separate reasons – yet as everything in global politics, their experiences have been interconnected. This review focuses on the Central and Eastern European region, that is the Chapters 1 and 2, where the authors rethink post-Soviet history from the current situation of Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, which is seen as the bedrock of the current deep crisis of liberal democracies around the world.</p><p>The world, according to Krastev and Holmes, is divided into the West and the Rest and the Rest al-ways envied the West and was driven by an obsession to imitate it. Here, the East primarily refers to the post-communist East, a part of the World that, because of its communist totalitarian past, had di-verted from the ―normal‖ historical path to democracy, economic prosperity and cultural excellence, the path of the West. The post-communist states aspiring towards democracy and free market were immediately sent to school. The language with which the process and the societies of the region were described and with which they began to describe themselves mostly took the form of pedagogical tones, the phrase “growing up to democracy” had become an intrinsic part of the vocabulary of the so called transformation. This rhetoric has accompanied the democratic transition from the beginning and was accepted uncritically by the vast majority of the leaders of democratic change. Eastern European nonetheless eventually fell victim to the preexisting and incurable diseases which have been embedded inside the region, such as patrimonialism, nepotism, and corruption.</p><p>Krastev and Holmes are of course aware of the effect socioeconomic conditions have on the loss of hope and momentum in the liberal project, however their consideration is somehow exhausted by the economic crisis of 2008. Liberalism’s reputation, they write, never recovered from it. The financial crisis and the rise of populism may indicate that the self-legitimization processes of liberalism, which depended on the fact that such a structure of society allowed sufficiently substantial sections of society to acquire a better standard of living (mostly based on credit) began to disintegrate after governments began to accept economic policy of so-called austerity in the post 2008 developments.</p><p>The East-West divide is of course and foremost an ideological phenomenon. Its ideological function is to show the West as emancipated from its own history, which in turn allows the West to be imposed as general and canonic, while the East is carrying the baggage of its own history which is peripheral and provincial. The result is that within the West-East divide, the East is forever doomed to struggle to get rid of its past, to struggle for recognition and to remain local, particular, and peripheral – in other words unable to attain the firmament of universality. The East within this divide is always determined in relation to the West, which is supposed to be universal. Boris Buden calls this rhetorical and argu-mentative tactic the “repressive infantilization” of nations, who are supposed to learn the democratic modus operandi from scratch and liberate themselves from their alleged communist mentality.</p><p>The crisis-of-democracy literature largely presumes that these debates have been settled, so that any doubts about that settlement must be symptoms of confusion or bad faith. The mainstream academic thinking, which this book is a prime example of, seems not to have come up with a workable analysis of either populism or the crisis of the liberal project. The current political situation in this anti-populist salon is debated in narrowly liberal democratic and western centric elitist frameworks, usually asking „how to prevent the escalation of populism“, how to provide a „remedy for this pathology of modern democracy“ and „maintain“ or restore existing political order“. In other words, populism is usually understood as an „unusual and pathological“ turn in (Western) politics that needs to be combated. „Anti-populism“ suddenly appears in the political field as a clear discursive repertoire, but it also hin-ders our ability to analyze changing organizational patterns of party politics, identify the rise of new political divisions rooted in the decline of traditional economic identities and political identification, and understand understanding the nature of social antagonisms and the complex processes of collec-tive identity formation. For one, what about the decline in liberal values in other nations, especially in Western Europe? And what about the divisions within the liberal camp? Can we really look at liberal democrats as one homogenous group? It takes only a few clips of recent debates in the European Par-liament to see that they have frequently disagreed about what liberalism is in practice.</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that the current form of liberal democracy and the ideological project of the EU do not have an answer to the questions posed by the current wave of discontent and dissent. What the ideological project of the EU can do effectively, is to marginalize these voices and assume that the order is constituted and there is no escaping it. The illusion of the unproblematic nature of the current institutional, political and economic design of the current version of the European project may be kept alive for some more time, however this illusion is likely to be carried on the backs of ever growing parts of the population. The tendency to naturalize the current ideology as the unquestioned horizon of our political possibilities is underlined by the familiar expression ‘there is no alternative’. The strength of the no alternative argument lies in the argument itself. If those in control of finance, politics and the media are not willing, or are unable, to even attempt to see an alternative none will be visible.</p><p>The segments of society who carry the labels of especially Eastern populists are often and colorfully portrayed as folklore and kitsch, liberal ideology of the European project is then portrayed as a guar-antee of the dominant political-economic state of affairs, a state that is considered normal. Krastev and Holmes grew up with this kind of language. The thing is that it doesn’t work. They try to restore the liberalism of the 90s only to find out that the life had gone out of it. Whatever had made it vital was gone, leaving behind empty forms and phrases. Krastev and Holmes identify correctly that the current wave of populism Populism in the West and the (post-communist) East is probably best understood an expression of the discontent with the way things have been for large segments of populations. However they stop short of delivering a truly meaningful analysis precisely because they are deeply rooted in the narratives and ideology of the early 90s which they helped to build. Liberal democracy and its ideology is never questioned and the deep crisis of western democracies is attributed to their imitation theory. </p><p>The Light that Failed: A Reckoning is a perfect representation of the current impasse of the western liberal camp, caught between a moral denunciation of the fallacies of the system and a refusal to take stock of their structural motivations, in other words – the present is wrong, but the future may be worse, therefore, in the meantime, let’s stick with what we have, tweak it a bit, and most importantly lie low, because some rocks may be incoming. What we are thus offered, in short, is a recipe of impo-tence. But perhaps the failure in projecting any coherent alternative is not a failure of imagination or analytical perceptiveness — virtues which both authors definitely do not lack. It is simply the reflec-tion of our structural reality, whereby labels like populist, East, West, illiberal, Trump, Putin or de-mocracy help defending the current state of affairs.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>Po dvou dnech a jedné noci, nemluvě o několika týdnech vzájemného obviňování a vydírání, se 27 vlád, Evropská komise (Komise) a Evropský parlament (Parlament) prohlásily za vítěze – všichni bez rozdílu. Zázrak? Nejdůležitější věc, kterou je třeba vědět o Bruselu, je, že nic zde není takové, jak to na první pohled vypadá, a vše lze prezentovat nekonečně mnoha způsoby. Navíc každého mate velký počet hráčů a polí, na nichž hrají. Všichni pracují v institucionálním rámci, kterému se říká „primární evropské právo“ a který je tak složitý, že tomu nikdo zvenčí nerozumí. Obratní manipulátoři zde nacházejí nepřeberně příležitostí pro mlžení, procedurální kejkle, alibistickou nejednoznačnost, předstírání a výmluvy – protichůdné interpretace a alternativní fakta jsou srdečně vítány. A, na to nezapomínejme, to vše je korunováno dobře zažitou tichou dohodou členů nejexkluzivnějšího a nejtajnůstkářštějšího klubu hlav států a předsedů vlád členských zemí (Evropské rady), že je povinností všech dbát na to, aby se nikdo z nich nikdy nevracel domů jako poražený. Všichni ochotně hrají pořád stejnou hru.</p><p>Podívejme se na Fond obnovy po koronaviru. Za prvé, je třeba si uvědomit, že to nemá nic společného s koronavirem, ale všechno s obranou italské vlády před politickým tlakem M. Salviniho. Za druhé, je třeba vědět, že to nemá rovněž nic společného s nějakou evropskou solidaritou: každá země něco dostane, ale nikdo nic neplatí, protože celý fond je založen pouze a jen na dluzích. Jedná se o nadnárodní rozšíření zadluženosti. Nikdo navíc neví, jak bude tento dluh spravován a splácen. A nikomu to nedělá starosti, protože to se začne řešit až za pár let. Buď se to zalepí dalším dluhem, nebo se použije nějaký tajemný kanál přes Evropskou centrální banku (ECB). Samozřejmě, něco takového je v rozporu s primárním evropským právem, ale nikomu to nejspíše nevadí. Jak se zdá, musí 27 parlamentů členských států odsouhlasit financování, ale nikdo si s tím neláme hlavu, protože každý dostane svůj podíl z kořisti.</p><p>To vše ale neznamená mír a přátelství. Říše závisejí na úspěšné správě periferií centrálními elitami. V Evropské unii musí být periferní elity neochvějně „proevropské“, což znamená, že jsou pro „ještě větší sjednocení evropských národů“ pod vedením Německa, za podpory Francie a prostřednictvím bruselské byrokracie. Německo a Evropská komise již dlouho podezřívaly současné vlády Polska a Maďarska, že nejsou dostatečně „proevropské“. Podobné podezření sdílí také Parlament, který si říká evropský, v němž členové chladní k myšlence „více Evropy“ nejsou zrovna v oblibě. („Více Evropy“ je raison d’être tohoto podivného Parlamentu, který nemá ani opozici, ani legislativní pravomoc.) Europoslanci z liberálních opozičních stran Maďarska a Polska tak nacházejí dostatečnou podporu pro zadržování evropských peněz pro jejich neliberální vlády, což má voliče přesvědčit o tom, že získají od „Evropy“ víc peněz, pokud budou hlasovat pro „proevropské“ strany. Proč tedy nepodmínit vyplácení prostředků z Fondu obnovy po koronaviru dodržováním „vlády práva“, přičemž „vládu práva“ definujeme tak, aby ji politiky neliberálních volených vlád nesplňovaly?</p><p>Zní to dobře? No, ale máme zde primární evropské právo. Podle tohoto práva si členské země, včetně Polska a Maďarska, zachovávají suverenitu, a o jejich domácích institucích a politice, jako např. zákonech o rodině a imigraci, rozhodují jejich elektoráty, a nikoliv Brusel nebo Berlín. Pokud jde o legislativní instituce jednotlivých zemí, má se EU starat pouze o to, zda jsou prostředky použity správným způsobem a náležitě vyúčtovány. V tomto ohledu nelze Polsku nic vytknout. Maďarsko je na tom sice hůř, ale pořád si vede lépe než některé „proevropské“ státy jako Bulharsko nebo Rumunsko. O Maltě ani nemluvě. Tak co s tím?</p><p>V Bruselu si vždy ví rady. Komise se nějakou dobu snažila potrestat Polsko a Maďarsko podle různých ustanovení primárního evropského práva, která členským zemím zakazují vměšovat se do nezávislosti soudů. Ale takový kalibr se členské země zdráhaly Komisi schválit. (Navíc zde vyvstávají nepříjemné otázky např. ohledně nezávislosti francouzské Státní rady.) Teď tu ale máme Fond obnovy po koronaviru a společně s ním tzv. „mechanismus vlády práva (ROLM – Rule of Law Mechanism). Pokud podle nich nemáte nezávislou justici včetně liberálního ústavního soudu, nebo třeba pokud odmítáte přijímat uprchlíky podle imperativu lidských práv a nechcete se podřizovat kvótám EU, není zde záruka, že řádně vyúčtujete evropské peníze.</p><p>Může to fungovat? V Bruselu je všechno možné. Logika je stejná, jako když ECB uspěla u Evropského soudního dvora proti Německému ústavnímu soudu (rozhodnutí ohledně PSPP). Primární evropské právo omezuje ECB na monetární politiku. Fiskální politika zůstává na členských státech. Ale ECB dnes argumentuje, že monetární politiku dnes již nelze oddělovat od fiskální politiky. Z toho pak vyplývá, že i fiskální politika by nyní měla spadat pod pravomoc centrální banky. V reakci na to německý soud, nyní hojně citován v Polsku a Maďarsku, trval na tom, že kompetence Evropy jsou přísně omezeny na to, k čemu se členské země zavázaly přijetím primárního evropského práva, a pokud si Evropa žádá více kompetencí, musí se nejdřív odpovídajícím způsobem změnit primární evropské právo. To ale vyžaduje jednohlasný souhlas všech. Na tomto pozadí se rozvinul současný střet.</p><p>Tah I (EU): Zveme vás k účasti na Fondu obnovy po koronaviru, který zahrnuje ROLM a možnost, že nic nedostanete, pokud nezměníte své neliberální postupy.</p><p>Protitah (Polsko a Maďarsko): Pro takový mechanismus nikdy ruku nezvedneme, takže na Fond zapomeňte. Veto!</p><p>Tah II: Když budete hlasovat proti mechanismu, a tedy i proti Fondu, vytvoříme Fond pouze pro zbývajících 25 států a najdeme pro to v primárním evropském právu oporu. Primární evropské právo je dostatečně složité a papír, jak říkají Němci, je trpělivý. Nedostanete ani cent.</p><p>Protitah: To od vás nebude hezké, nebude to evropské (ale to si jenom myslí!) a bude to nezákonné.</p><p>Sbor, ztělesněný německým tiskem, zpívá a tančí: Vidíte, prachy fungují. Udělají, co po nich chceme, protože chtějí naše peníze. Být bohatý je skvělé.</p><p>Na scénu přicházejí prezidenti, nastává hodina pravdy. Vede je Angela Merkelová, dea ex machina, paní jednání za zavřenými dveřmi, zastupující zemi, která, jenom tak náhodou, formálně vládne všem ostatním zemím posledních pár let. A neformálně ještě déle. Německo potřebuje východní Evropu pro byznys. Také cítí, že nemůže dovolit Američanům získat monopol v rusofobní geopolitice. To vyžaduje pustit se do křížku s Polskem o otázku polské suverenity. Po určitých tahanicích, v příšeří mezivládní diplomacie, souhlasí Polsko a Maďarsko s Fondem. Součástí je dokument, podle něhož vydá Komise „Směrnici na ochranu rozpočtu“, která podmiňuje koronavirové a ve skutečnosti každé dotace národní legislativou dostatečně nezávislou, aby mohla správně vyúčtovat peníze přijaté od EU. Směrnice však nenabude účinnosti, dokud nebude schválena evropským soudem. Do té doby – tedy minimálně do března 2023 – podle ní nebude Komise jednat a peníze bude dostávat všech 27 států. Jednou, pokud se tak stane a mechanismus bude soudem schválen, může Komise zahájit řízení proti Polsku, Maďarsku nebo oběma státům, a požadovat vrácení vydaných peněz na základě toho, že polský a maďarský právní systém jsou natolik prohnilé, že od nich nelze očekávat, že by jejich rozhodnutí bylo v souladu s „vládou práva“. To se, samozřejmě, potáhne a nikdo dnes netuší, v jakém stavu v té době bude svět a kterých členských států se to bude týkat.</p><p>Ochranná lhůta dělá v Evropě divy. Po určitou dobu jsou všichni spokojení: prezidenti, Parlament (který schválil potřebné dodatky), Komise (která má novou hračku, s kterou může šikanovat členské státy a cítit se důležitě), Soudní dvůr (jehož pravomoci každým dnem sílí) a národní vlády včetně Maďarska a Polska (které nebudou mluvit o neformálních ujištěných získaných pod pultem). Politika odkladů, kterou má A. Merkelová tak ráda, zná pouze vítěze – dokud vydrží.</p>"

                        "text": "<h2>1. The Failure</h2><p>Legal studies are at their lowest point in history. Whatever their leaning, they seem to be unable to produce anything resembling an understanding of law – let alone possible uses of its tools. Legal studies, nowadays, seem to be trapped in some grotesque parody of what academy, according to some weird Ivy League fantasy, should look like, without any of its expected outcomes. On the one hand, we have scholars aiming at proving time and again why everything legal and juridical is right as it is, while others, on the other hand, are desperately trying to show how everything is wrong. Beyond this attribution of values and the parroting of theories supposed to justify it, nothing happens – but bland, boring, useless bavardage. The only domain in which, apparently, there is some life left in law is the one of legal history – whose field, at least, stays structured according to real standards of research. The rest simply is discount academia – and boredom galore. There is no surprise, then, if law is falling more and more outside of the scope not only of researchers from other fields, but also of the general public, whose views on it more and more resemble to the clichés jumped out of an HBO or Netflix procedural series. Perhaps could it be heralded as a success – but only for those who would consider that transforming law into a completely esoteric discipline is a good thing. For saner minds, this is the saddest picture one can thing of: the one “a crucial fixture of democracy” being considered as so dull and uninteresting that its knowledge is now reserved to equally dull and uninteresting interpreters. The problem, however, is not so much boredom as what boredom entails: a general laziness when it comes to think the machinery of law – and the possibilities entailed in it. For decades now, at least since the advent of Kelsenian orthodoxy, law has been considered as a set of general and abstract norms whose validity depends upon its inscription within a given, legitimate, institutional system. Nobody, from whatever side of the church, wouldn’t even discuss this claim – except, perhaps, for putting into question the legitimacy of said institutional system, or the perversion of the validation process of rules. Depending on the day, society, politics, economy, ethics or even aesthetics will come to the rescue – so that the core claim remains untouched: law is, and must be, about rules, norms, regulations, ought-to-be. If there is something that distinguishes law from other practices, it is this one: law is the social fabric of the normative. Problem is: nothing could be more wrong.</p><h2>2. The Mistake</h2><p>Law is not, and has never been, about norms. This means that, contrarily to what is still considered as not even deserving consideration, law has nothing to do with all the activities pertaining to the conception, adoption, proclamation, execution, interpretation and application of rules, regulations, legislation, and the like. To put it into even clearer terms: law has never had anything to do with governments, legislators and judges. These three spheres certainly belong to the institutional equipment of societies – but as political accessories, so to speak. There are the cheap jewels thrown at the face of laymen while the important issues are dealt with elsewhere. If we still consider that law’s reality is directly related to said spheres, it is only because of a remarkable chance: the coming to the rescue of “law” of a Greek invention whose consequences are still a heavy burden – namely, philosophy. The invention of the category of nomos, and its philosophical description as an order whose function was to parallel the organisation of the sky with the one of the Earth, has given nobility to what was, until then, a simple set of thesmoi whose consequences were strictly local. With the idea of nomos, the assumption that law, whatever it is, could play a role in the ordering of the city, and in bridging it together with a higher level of necessities, suddenly received some credence. Of course, it was long fought against – especially by Roman lawyers, who saw no necessity to confuse what they were doing with the wet dreams of philosophers or advocates wanting to submit the functioning of law to principles whose choice and definition they were reserving for them alone. It literally took more than a millennium for the idea of law as directly linked to the normative order of societies to be accepted – but only because of the fantastic amnesia of lawyers themselves. Such an amnesia, however, was quite easily understandable: after all, lawyers were part of a transaction stipulating that if they were to accept this understanding of law, then they would be a part of those who would decide about it. This transaction was put forth by Cicero and his followers in Ancient Rome, by the Humanists at the time of Renaissance, by philosophers during Enlightenment, etc. Yet, it was never fully acknowledged because, otherwise, the ideal law that had so been designed wouldn’t simply function – as its functioning is, and has always been, based on something else that rules and norms, nomoi and leges. Law is not a deontic practice. It is much more.</p><h2>3. The Story</h2><p>What is law, then? The answer is pretty simple. So simple, even, that it is really funny to see, repeated from treatise to treatise, the notion that law would be hard to define, and that definitions abound, contradicting each other. This is not true. If there has never been a stable definition of law in recent times, it is only because all the suggested ones were simply concentrating on what law is not – but should ideally be, so that the order of things that it is supposed to guarantee, would not be put into question. Because what law is, is the following: law is the operator of the necessity of continuities. And that is all. What law is, is what it does. And what it does is to set up linkages – or, to be more precise, articulations. Law is the set of operations that articulates continuities – that builds up continuities in such a way that other operations could follow. Romans had a word for that: ius. Unfortunately, the inherent limitations of English makes it impossible to distinguish between law understood as lex (or nomos) and law understood as ius. Usually, this word is mistakenly translated with “rights” – which is the weakest translation one could think of. For what does “rights” mean? The faculties given to a certain subject by a certain law. Rights are the product of rules and regulations – they are tickets for players to enter the deontic game. As such, though, they don’t do anything. They are just there to allow someone to claim the application of a given rule to his case – or to deny such an application to someone else (be it an authority). “Rights” are the subjective side of legislation. Ius, on another hand, is a word that had nothing to do with legislation or normativity. As numerous legal historians and linguists have shown, ius meant law in a non-deontic sense – as in “juridical”, as opposed to “legal”. What is juridical is not the norms and regulations that the authorities of a society have adopted and intend to see applied, but the operations through which such an application is even thinkable. These operations, such as marriage, filiation, obligation, qualification, adoption, etc., have never ever been conceived through deontic devices. Nowadays, in every single legal system of the world (or considered as such), the main categories articulating the functioning of rules and adjudication are not legal categories – are not categories designed and defined through laws. The have been created and perfected by jurisconsults throughout history, so that they can contribute to the solving of impossibilities – and keep law going.</p><h2>4. The Proposal</h2><p>What does this mean? It means that, as far as law is concerned, the study of rules and judgments are a pure waste of time. If one is to study law in a non-superficial way, it is the ensemble of operations constituting ius that has to become the focus of attention. But it also means that spending fantastic amounts of time and energy in trying to understand why and how the institutional system of lex is right or wrong is both pointless and useless. We don’t need to keep on searching for the ultimate guarantee, legitimation or justification of law – be it the political consent and interest of the population (or its dominated parts, whatever they are). We don’t need to try and determine what are the external factors putting into question the purity of the internal reasons defended by the most stubborn positivists – because it is exactly the same thing. In both cases, it misses law altogether. No doubt that it would be of a great interest for sociologists or political scientists, but certainly not for lawyers. Since it amounts to considering law from the point of view of the limit, positivists, naturalists, realists, race theorists, feminist jurisprudence scholars, law &amp; economics researchers (an oxymoron if there ever was one), etc., are all critical. When Emmanuel Kant, at the helm of modernity, defined its critical program, it was precisely on these terms: the one of the limiting of reason – and of the verification of the adequation of the functioning of reason to the norms that subjects would have chosen together. The focus on the deontic, in order to either defend or destroy its current status, is then the focus on critique, precisely seen as the moment of judgment of what is – and, of course, of its condemnation if it doesn’t fit with its program. Shifting the perspective towards the operations of law, however, may allow for another point of view, not interested in limitations and impossibilities anymore, but on what law can do – and could do. This would imply to insist on how invention provides the key to the history of ius, from the Romans to the present, and then a certain sense of the possible. Law has never been about negating possibilities, but about finding tricks to negotiate with what was reputed impossible. Time, nature, death, biology, geography: there is nothing that the operations of law couldn’t transgress – and as daily as with an adoption, or our interactions with abstractions such as “the State”. But, for that, we need to pass past the critical stage of legal studies, and, at last, open up to its post-critical horizon.</p><h2>5. The Goal</h2><p>This task is rendered all the more urgent by the current political, economical, ecological and even ethical moment that we are living. Carrying on with the consensus that has defined modern law, both in order to defend it or to try and undermine it, can only lead to a growing marginalization of law. This time, however, this marginalization will not take the form of contempt or ignorance from the laymen, but from those responsible for the ediction and application of rules themselves – be it at the level of governments, parliaments and tribunals. Since the focus on lex has given free reign to the idea that law is only about rules and regulations, the juridical constraints that the operations of ius incarnate can be set aside with a more and more visible impudence. If law is only made out of norms, then those who possess the power to decide about norms can also claim the power to decide about the possibilities that law can help in exploring (or not). Confronted to the rise of an autocratic tendency even at the core of countries considering themselves as paragon examples of “rule of law”-governed State, forgetting about the operational nature of law is the equivalent of forgetting law altogether – and replacing it with an object upon which political sides can endlessly argue. By adopting a post-critical gaze, shifting interest from norms to operations, on the contrary, there is a chance to re-equip lawyers themselves in their struggle for making law a relevant actor within a crumbling political field – an actor that could compete with politics, economics, science, religion, and so on, in the formulation of possibilities for future societies. To put it in another way: it is not so much the militants that should get accustomed to law again, than the lawyers who have to turn into militants – because law is by nature militant. It is militant not necessarily because of a its political leaning; it is militant insofar as it seeks to keep intact its own capacity to invention in the face of proclaimed impossibilities. The consequence should be clear, then: law is not on the side of order, but on the one of chaos; it is the exploration of the possibilities that orders, whatever they purpose or tendency, always try to control – with words like “reality”, “justice”, “life”, etc. Since legal operations can reverse time, make dead people act, reinvent the nature of things so that farm dogs can become the equivalent of bricks, etc., “reality”, or “justice”, or “life”, or whatever else, cannot be considered as relevant limits for law. Ius is limitless – and this is why it is, intrinsically, revolutionary.</p>"
